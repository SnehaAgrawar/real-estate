## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd real-estate-project
    ```

3. Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

4. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

5. Set up the environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add necessary configuration details (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).
    - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory if needed for environment-specific configurations.

6. Start the development servers:
    - Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        cd ../backend
        npm start
        ```

    - Start the frontend server:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        npm start
        ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
